Hi there,

<br><br> 

I am a confident Rails developer and a passionate Rubyist but I love exploring new languages and frameworks such as Angular, Play and NodeJS. <br>In addition to my web development projects I like to venture into Unity game development and as such have a basic understanding of C#.

<br><br>


Currently I am studying TDD/BDD (Selenium, Capybara and RSpec) as well as automation, continuous integration/deployment and Cloud Computing.<br> I am preparing for my AWS-CSA exam which I hope to complete at the end of March 2017.

<br><br>

I don't see myself as a specialist, but as a facilitator who aspires to further projects by engaging with different people along the way.


<br><br>
There is a lot I need to learn, but I never stand still and I am eager to discover new technologies and pick up new skills.
